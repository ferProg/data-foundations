# Linear Models — Exploratory Analysis and Simple Regression

This block covers the fundamentals of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and simple linear regression, with a focus on **understanding**, not optimization.

The goal is to learn how data behaves, what linear models can and cannot explain, and how interpretation changes depending on the analytical lens.

## 🧠 Key Principles Emphasized

- Visualization precedes modeling
- Metrics do not replace reasoning
- Linear models are explanatory tools, not universal solutions
- Simplicity and interpretability are prioritized over performance

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Only simple linear relationships are explored
- No hyperparameter tuning or model optimization
- No multivariate or non-linear models

These limitations are intentional and aligned with the educational goal of this block.
