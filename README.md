## Statistics Foundations

This repository documents my learning process in statistics and data analysis.

The focus is on:
- understanding data through tables and visualizations
- describing distributions
- interpreting results critically
- connecting statistics with real data using Python

This is a learning-in-public repository: clarity and reasoning matter more than polish.
