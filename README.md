# Data Foundations – Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains a structured set of notebooks focused on the fundamentals of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

The goal of this project is to build a solid understanding of how to explore, describe, and interpret data before applying statistical tests or machine learning models.

## Project Structure

- `data/`  
  Contains simple, clean CSV files used for demonstration purposes.

- `notebooks/`  
  Sequential notebooks covering core EDA concepts.

## EDA Notebooks Overview

### 01 – Reading Tables and Categorical Data  
Introduces basic data loading, frequency tables, and bar charts.  
Focuses on understanding what can and cannot be concluded from categorical counts.

### 02 – Describing Quantitative Data  
Explores histograms, mean, and median.  
Highlights how different summaries affect interpretation.

### 03 – Distributions, Skewness, and Outliers  
Examines distribution shape, skewness, and extreme values.  
Emphasizes the role of visualization in detecting structure and anomalies.

### 04 – Comparing Distributions Across Groups  
Compares quantitative distributions between groups using boxplots.  
Discusses observed differences while avoiding causal claims.

### 05 – Variability, IQR, and Standard Deviation  
Focuses on different measures of variability and their interpretation.  
Shows how dispersion metrics capture different aspects of the data.

### 06 – Relationships Between Quantitative Variables  
Uses scatter plots to explore relationships between variables.  
Stresses the difference between association and causation.

## Key Principles

Across all notebooks, the emphasis is on:
- Clear visual exploration
- Appropriate use of summary statistics
- Awareness of interpretation limits
- Avoiding unwarranted conclusions

This project intentionally avoids advanced modeling in order to strengthen foundational data reasoning skills.

## Next Steps

Possible extensions include:
- Linear trend approximation
- Correlation vs causation examples
- Introduction to simple statistical tests
- Transition from EDA to modeling
